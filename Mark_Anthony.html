<h1> Mark Anthony, written by <cite> 'unknown' author </cite>, posted on 31/3/2024 </h1>
<h2 class = "box0"> General stuff </h2>

<p> Marcus Antonius (14 January 83 BC â€“ 1 August 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from a constitutional republic into the autocratic Roman Empire. </p>

<p> Antony was a relative and supporter of Julius Caesar, and he served as one of his generals during the conquest of Gaul and the Caesar's civil war. Antony was appointed administrator of Italy while Caesar eliminated political opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain. After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Antony joined forces with Lepidus, another of Caesar's generals, and Octavian, Caesar's great-nephew and adopted son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the Second Triumvirate. The Triumvirs defeated Caesar's killers, the Liberatores, at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, and divided the government of the Republic between themselves. Antony was assigned Rome's eastern provinces, including the client kingdom of Egypt, then ruled by Cleopatra VII Philopator, and was given the command in Rome's war against Parthia. </p>

<p> Relations among the triumvirs were strained as the various members sought greater political power. Civil war between Antony and Octavian was averted in 40 BC, when Antony married Octavian's sister, Octavia. Despite this marriage, Antony carried on a love affair with Cleopatra, who bore him three children, further straining Antony's relations with Octavian. Lepidus was expelled from the association in 36 BC, and in 33 BC, disagreements between Antony and Octavian caused a split between the remaining Triumvirs. Their ongoing hostility erupted into civil war in 31 BC when Octavian induced the republic to declare war on Cleopatra and proclaim Antony a traitor. Later that year, Antony was defeated by Octavian's forces at the Battle of Actium. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt where, having again been defeated at the Battle of Alexandria, they committed suicide. </p>

<p> With Antony dead, Octavian became the undisputed master of the Roman world. In 27 BC, Octavian was granted the title of Augustus, marking the final stage in the transformation of the Roman Republic into an empire, with himself as the first Roman emperor. </p>
<br>
<h2 class = "box0"> Family + Personal Life </h2>
<p> Antony was known to have an obsession with women and sex. He had many mistresses (including Cytheris) and was married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia, Octavia and Cleopatra. He left a number of children. Through his daughters by Octavia, he would be ancestor to the Roman emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero. </p>
<ul>  
	<li> Marriage to Fadia, a daughter of a freedman. According to Cicero, Fadia bore Antony several children. Nothing is known about Fadia or their children. Cicero is the only Roman source that mentions Antony's first wife. </li>
	<li> Marriage to first paternal cousin Antonia Hybrida Minor, daughter of Gaius Antonius Hybrida. According to Plutarch, Antony threw her out of his house in Rome because she slept with his friend, the tribune Publius Cornelius Dolabella. This occurred by 47 BC and Antony divorced her. By Antonia, he had a daughter:
	<ol><li> Antonia, married the wealthy Greek Pythodoros of Tralles. </li></ol>
	</li>
	<li> Marriage to Fulvia, by whom he had two sons:
	<ol> 
		<li> Marcus Antonius Antyllus, murdered by Octavian in 30 BC. </li>
		<li> Iullus Antonius, married Claudia Marcella the Elder, daughter of Octavia. </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li> Marriage to Octavia the Younger, sister of Octavian, later emperor Augustus; they had two daughters:
	<ol> 
		<li> Antonia the Elder married Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC); maternal grandmother of the Empress Valeria Messalina and paternal grandmother of the emperor Nero. </li>
		<li> Antonia the Younger married Nero Claudius Drusus, the younger son of the Empress Livia Drusilla and brother of the emperor Tiberius; mother of the emperor Claudius, paternal grandmother of the emperor Caligula and empress Agrippina the Younger, and maternal great-grandmother of the emperor Nero. </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li> Children with the Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, the former lover of Julius Caesar: 
	<ol>  
		<li> Alexander Helios </li>
		<li> Cleopatra Selene II, married King Juba II of Numidia and later Mauretania; the queen of Syria, Zenobia of Palmyra, was reportedly descended from Selene and Juba II. </li>
		<li> Ptolemy Philadelphus </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
